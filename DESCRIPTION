Description: The package replicates the game on the TV show "Let's 
    Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant to choose 
    from, one of which has a car behind it and the other two have goats. 
    The contestant selects a door, then the host opens a door to reveal 
    a goat, and then the contestant is given an opportunity to stay with 
    their original selection or switch to the other unopened door. Upon 
    selection, the contestant is determined to win or lose. The package
    condenses the code into one action and then plays the game 100 times.
